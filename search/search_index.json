The platform provides the following ingredients: Meta-languages for high-level declarative language definition An interactive environment for developing languages using these meta-languages Code generators that produces parsers, type checkers, compilers, interpreters, and other tools from language definitions Generation of full-featured Eclipse editor plugins from language definitions An API for programmatically combining the components of a language implementation With Spoofax you can focus on the essence of language definition and ignore irrelevant implementation details. Installation \u00b6 The recommended way to get started with Spoofax is to install the Spoofax Eclipse plugin. The plugin also includes the Spoofax meta-languages. Choose the Eclipse Bundle installation (recommended), the Eclipse Plugin installation, or the Command-Line installation: Eclipse Bundle Download an Eclipse instance with an embedded Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and the latest Spoofax plugin pre-installed for your platform: macOS Intel 64-bit Linux x64 (64-bit) Windows x64 (64-bit) Windows x86 (32-bit) Installation instructions . Download Eclipse with Spoofax without an embedded JRE . Homebrew macOS On macOS Spoofax can be installed easily using Homebrew . Install the latest release of Spoofax Eclipse as follows: brew tap metaborg/metaborg brew install --cask spoofax The optional command-line tools are installed with: brew install strategoxt Upgrading the Spoofax cask is not recommended Upgrading the Spoofax cask using brew cask upgrade --greedy will lose all manually installed plugins. It is recommended to use Eclipse update sites to keep Spoofax up-to-date. Eclipse Plugin Perform a manual installation of the Spoofax plugin in Eclipse 3.5 or newer through the update site: http://artifacts.metaborg.org/content/unzip/releases-unzipped/org/metaborg/org.metaborg.spoofax.eclipse.updatesite/2.5.15/org.metaborg.spoofax.eclipse.updatesite-2.5.15-assembly.zip-unzip/ Installation instructions .

Provide a name for your new language and click Finish . Select the created language project and press Ctrl + Alt + B ( Cmd + Alt + B on macOS) to build the project. Create a new file with the extension registered to your language to test it. Follow one of the tutorials to learn more. Finding the filename extension of your language If you didn't explicitly specify a filename extension for your language, it is derived from the language name. You can find the filename extension for your language in editor/Main.esv at the extensions property.","title":"Spoofax Language Workbench"},{"location":"#spoofax-language-workbench","text":"Spoofax is a platform for developing textual (domain-specific) programming languages.
