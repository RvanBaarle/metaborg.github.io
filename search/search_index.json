Technology \u00b6 This documentation uses MkDocs , a fast and simple static site generated that's geared towards building project documentation from Markdown files. In particular, this website uses MkDocs Material , which provides a clean look, easy customization, and many features for technical documentation. Structure \u00b6 The structure of this documentation follows the Grand Unified Theory of Documentation where documentation is split into four categories: Tutorials : oriented to learning , enabling newcomers to get started through a lesson, analogous to teaching a child how to cook. How-Tos : oriented to a particular goal , showing how to solve a specific problem through a series of steps, analogous to a recipe in a cookbook. Reference : oriented to information , describing the machinery through dry description, analogous to an encyclopaedia article. Background : oriented to understanding , explaining through discursive explanation, analogous to an article on culinary social history. Contributing \u00b6 Contributing to the documentation is easy. Quick changes and fixing typos can be done by clicking the button in the top-right corner of a page, and editing and saving the underlying Markdown file. More considerable contributions can be made by cloning this repository locally, and editing the Markdown files there. The easiest way to get a live preview (automatically reloading) of your changes, is by installing Docker and executing make from the root directory. This will serve the latest changes to localhost:8000 . MkDocs Reference Extensions Reference Adding Pages \u00b6 The first page mentioned in nav under a section should be some index.md (without a title), and will be used as the index page (home page) for that section. When you add a new page, don't forget to add it to the nav element in the mkdocs.yml file, or it will not show up. Links \u00b6 Links to other Markdown pages should be written as relative links. For example, to link to tutorials from the background/index.md page, write the relative link including the Markdown file: ```markdown [Tutorials](../tutorials/index.md) ``` Absolute Links are Not Supported Absolute links are not supported, and while they may work locally, they break in production. Citations \u00b6 To cite a paper or work, first ensure the citation is in a bibliography ( .bib ) file in the /bibliographies/ directory. For example, in the bibliographies/tudelft.bib file, we find: @inproceedings { KatsV10a , title = {The {Spoofax} language workbench} , author = {Lennart C. L. Kats and Eelco Visser} , year = {2010} , doi = {10.1145/1869542.1869592} , url = {http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1869542.1869592} , pages = {237-238} , booktitle = {Companion to the 25th Annual ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Object-Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages, and Applications, SPLASH/OOPSLA 2010, October 17-21, 2010, Reno/Tahoe, Nevada, USA} , } Then reference the work like this: The Spoofax language workbench[^1] is a vital to declarative language development. Finally, add a place for the bibliography footnotes to be added (usually at the end of the file) by adding the following line to the file: [^1]: Lennart C\\. L\\. Kats and Eelco Visser\\.
