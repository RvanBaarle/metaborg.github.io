Technology \u00b6 This documentation uses MkDocs , a fast and simple static site generated that's geared towards building project documentation from Markdown files. In particular, this website uses MkDocs Material , which provides a clean look, easy customization, and many features for technical documentation. Structure \u00b6 The structure of this documentation follows the Grand Unified Theory of Documentation where documentation is split into four categories: Tutorials : oriented to learning , enabling newcomers to get started through a lesson, analogous to teaching a child how to cook. How-Tos : oriented to a particular goal , showing how to solve a specific problem through a series of steps, analogous to a recipe in a cookbook. Reference : oriented to information , describing the machinery through dry description, analogous to an encyclopaedia article. Background : oriented to understanding , explaining through discursive explanation, analogous to an article on culinary social history. Contributing \u00b6 Contributing to the documentation is easy. Quick changes and fixing typos can be done by clicking the button in the top-right corner of a page, and editing and saving the underlying Markdown file. More considerable contributions can be made by cloning this repository locally, and editing the Markdown files there. The easiest way to get a live preview (automatically reloading) of your changes, is by installing Docker and executing make from the root directory. This will serve the latest changes to localhost:8000 . MkDocs Reference Extensions Reference Adding Pages \u00b6 The first page mentioned in nav under a section should be some index.md (without a title), and will be used as the index page (home page) for that section. When you add a new page, don't forget to add it to the nav element in the mkdocs.yml file, or it will not show up. Links \u00b6 Links to other Markdown pages should be written as relative links. For example, to link to tutorials from the background/index.md page, write the relative link including the Markdown file: ```markdown [Tutorials](../tutorials/index.md) ``` Absolute Links are Not Supported Absolute links are not supported, and while they may work locally, they break in production. Citations \u00b6 To cite a paper or work, first ensure the citation is in a bibliography ( .bib ) file in the /bibliographies/ directory. For example, in the bibliographies/spoofax.bib file, we find: @inproceedings { KatsV10 , title = {The {Spoofax} language workbench: rules for declarative specification of languages and {IDEs}} , author = {Lennart C. L. Kats and Eelco Visser} , year = {2010} , doi = {10.1145/1869459.1869497} , url = {https://doi.org/10.1145/1869459.1869497} , pages = {444-463} , booktitle = {Proceedings of the 25th Annual ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Object-Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages, and Applications, OOPSLA 2010} , } Adding References To add a reference, add it on Researchr to the Spoofax bibliography . Then on the command-line, invoke the following to regenerate the spoofax.bib file: make bib Do not change the spoofax.bib file manually, it is generated and updated through Researchr . Then reference the work like this: The Spoofax language workbench[@KatsV10] is vital to declarative language development. Finally, add a place for the bibliography footnotes to be added (usually at the end of the file) by adding the following line to the file: \\bibliography The line will be rendered as: The Spoofax language workbench 1 is vital to declarative language development. And the references will be at the bottom of this page. If the citation appears rendered as Spoofax language workbench[^1] , then you might have forgotten to add a place for the bibliography.

When using Stratego for program transformation, terms typically represent the abstract syntax tree of a program. But Stratego does not much care what a term represents. Terms can just as well represent structured documents, software models, or anything else that can be rendered in a structured format. Generally program text is transformed into a term by means of parsing, and turned back into program text by means of pretty-printing. One way to achieve this is by using [SDF3]{.doc} . For most of the examples, we will just assume that we have terms that should be transformed and ignore parsing and pretty-printing. However, when we turn to running examples in the Spoofax environment in the Eclipse IDE, we will rely on SDF3 as that is the primary way to produce terms in Spoofax/Eclipse. Annotated Term Format \u00b6 Terms in Stratego are terms in the Annotated Term Format , or ATerms for short. The ATerm format provides a set of constructs for representing trees, comparable to XML or abstract data types in functional programming languages. For example, the code 4 + f(5 * x) might be represented in a term as: Plus(Int(\"4\"), Call(\"f\", [Mul(Int(\"5\"), Var(\"x\"))])) ATerms are constructed from the following elements: Integer : An integer constant, that is a list of decimal digits, is an ATerm. Examples: 1 , 12343 {.docutils .literal .notranslate}. String : A string constant, that is a list of characters between double quotes is an ATerm. Special characters such as double quotes and newlines should be escaped using a backslash. The backslash character itself should be escaped as well. Examples: \"foobar\" , \"string with quotes\\\"\" , \"escaped escape character\\\\ and a newline\\n\" . Constructor application : A constructor is an identifier, that is an alphanumeric string starting with a letter, or a double quoted string. A constructor application c(t1,...,tn) creates a term by applying a constructor to a list of zero or more terms. For example, the term Plus(Int(\"4\"),Var(\"x\")) uses the constructors Plus , Int , and Var to create a nested term from the strings \"4\" and \"x\" . List : A list is a term of the form [t1,...,tn] , that is a list of zero or more terms between square brackets. While all applications of a specific constructor typically have the same number of subterms, lists can have a variable number of subterms. The elements of a list are typically of the same type, while the subterms of a constructor application can vary in type. Example: The second argument of the call to \"f\" in the term Call(\"f\",[Int(\"5\"),Var(\"x\")]) is a list of expressions. Tuple : A tuple (t1,...,tn) is a constructor application without a constructor. Example: (Var(\"x\"), Type(\"int\")) Annotation : The elements defined above are used to create the structural part of terms. Optionally, a term can be annotated with a list of terms. These annotations typically carry additional semantic information about the term. An annotated term has the form t{t1,...,tn} . Example: Lt(Var(\"n\"),Int(\"1\")){Type(\"bool\")} . The contents of annotations is up to the application. Persistent Representation \u00b6 The term format described above is used in Stratego programs to denote terms, but is also used to exchange terms between programs. Thus, the internal format and the external format exactly coincide. Of course, internally a Stratego program uses a data-structure in memory with pointers rather than manipulating a textual representation of terms.

For example, the term Plus(Int(\"4\"),Var(\"x\")) uses the constructors Plus , Int , and Var to create a nested term from the strings \"4\" and \"x\" . List : A list is a term of the form [t1,...,tn] , that is a list of zero or more terms between square brackets. While all applications of a specific constructor typically have the same number of subterms, lists can have a variable number of subterms. The elements of a list are typically of the same type, while the subterms of a constructor application can vary in type. Example: The second argument of the call to \"f\" in the term Call(\"f\",[Int(\"5\"),Var(\"x\")]) is a list of expressions. Tuple : A tuple (t1,...,tn) is a constructor application without a constructor. Example: (Var(\"x\"), Type(\"int\")) Annotation : The elements defined above are used to create the structural part of terms. Optionally, a term can be annotated with a list of terms. These annotations typically carry additional semantic information about the term. An annotated term has the form t{t1,...,tn} . Example: Lt(Var(\"n\"),Int(\"1\")){Type(\"bool\")} . The contents of annotations is up to the application.","title":"Annotated Term Format"},{"location":"references/stratego/terms/#persistent-representation","text":"The term format described above is used in Stratego programs to denote terms, but is also used to exchange terms between programs. Thus, the internal format and the external format exactly coincide. Of course, internally a Stratego program uses a data-structure in memory with pointers rather than manipulating a textual representation of terms. But this is completely hidden from the Stratego programmer.","title":"Persistent Representation"},{"location":"references/stratego/terms/#namespaces","text":"qualified names ...

A signature declares a number of sorts and a number of constructors for these sorts. For each constructor, a signature declares the number and types of its arguments. For example, the following signature declares some typical constructors for constructing abstract syntax trees of expressions in a programming language: signature sorts Id Exp constructors : String -> Id Var : Id -> Exp Int : Int -> Exp Plus : Exp * Exp -> Exp Mul : Exp * Exp -> Exp Call : Id * List(Exp) -> Exp Currently, the Stratego compiler only checks the arity of constructor applications against the signature. Still, it is considered good style to also declare the types of constructors in a sensible manner for the purpose of documentation.
