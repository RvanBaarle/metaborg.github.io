# How to Generate a Signature

It is tedious to write a signature that is in sync with a syntax definition.
Therefore, Spoofax automatically generates a signature from a syntax definition for the abstract syntax trees that the parser for that syntax definition produces.

## Signature from Syntax Definition

Signatures can be generated automatically from a syntax definition in [SDF3](../../syntax/).
That ensures that the signature describes exactly the abstract syntax terms generated by a parser generated from that syntax definition.
Furthermore, an automatically generated pretty-printer maps terms conforming to such a signature to a well-formed textual representation of the program.

## Example Signature

For example, the following signature declares some typical constructors for constructing abstract syntax trees of expressions in a programming language:

```stratego
signature
  sorts Id Exp
  constructors
           : string -> Id
    Var    : Id -> Exp
    Int    : Int -> Exp
    Plus   : Exp * Exp -> Exp
    Mul    : Exp * Exp -> Exp
    Call   : Id  * List(Exp) -> Exp
```

Note that the first injection allows strings to be used as identifiers (`Id`).
